tokyotyrant aims to be a complete python wrapper for the Tokyo Tyrant client library by Mikio Hirabayashi (http://1978th.net/). While there are other wrappers out there none were found to be comprehensive enough.

A similar effort is underway for the Tokyo Cabinet API here: http://code.google.com/p/python-tokyocabinet/

Omissions, bugs, patches and feedback are greatly welcome. This package is written and maintained by Elisha Cook.
